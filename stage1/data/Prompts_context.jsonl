Let's go through a few examples to understand the process. Example 1: If a warehouse has 100 units and ships out 20, then receives 30, it ends with 110 units. Example 2: If a warehouse starts with 150 units, ships out 50, receives 25, and ships out another 10, it ends with 115 units. Now, apply this reasoning to the following task: A warehouse starts the day with 120 units of stock, ships out 35 units in the morning, receives a delivery equal to half of the remaining stock, and ships out 18 units in the afternoon. How many units remain at the end of the day?", "variant_id": 0}
